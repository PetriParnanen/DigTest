This is a simple user listing. Done for testing things. Right now it has inline editing. Sorting with clicking on the list headers. And adding new row or deleting. Because right now nothing is saved anywhere every time user comes back he has same default values in the list. Maybe will change some day, most likely not. Might add Redux and signup.

Frontend: React.JS
